## 🌈 What is SLM?

The **Sales Lead Management System** is like a super helper for sales teams! It’s a web app that makes it easy to manage sales leads, track who’s working, and keep everything organized. With cool features like **face recognition** to check attendance and **location tracking** to know where team members are, SLMS saves time and makes work smoother.

It’s perfect for teams working from home, in the office, or both! Plus, it’s super accurate—face recognition works **95% of the time** in tests. Whether you’re a boss or a team member, SLMS makes your job easier with a simple, friendly design. 🎉
